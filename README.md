# Testing 
Testing is a playground file for me to learn the Mocha framework and Chai assertion library. 

I'd like to see myself unit testing before writing functions in my own code, but before I do that, I want to get familiar with writing tests.

These are just basic algorithms that I'm writing my own tests too. While I am, of course, learning Mocha and Chai, I am also learning what to look out for. Getting into the mindset of who will try to mess up my code.

### Process:
1. Pick an algorithm from Free Code Camp. Do NOT solve on FCC's platform. Just find an algorithm.
2. In my own editor, create a file for the algorith, create function expression that is empty and export it.
3. In test.js, require the file with the function du jour
4. Using Mocha and Chai, build what I think are all the tests required to pass the FCC challenge. 
5. After I pass my tests, bring the function to FCC and see how I fare. I not only want to learn how to use assert, expect, and should within Chai, but to know what to include. 
6. Return to my own test and include what I forgot. 
7. Make my function pass round 2. 
8. Eat a cookie!
