# Testing 
Testing is a playground file for me to learn the Mocha framework and Chai assertion library. 

I'd like to see myself unit testing before writing functions in my own code, but before I do that, I want to get familiar with writing tests.

These are just basic algorithms that I'm writing my own tests too. While I am, of course, learning Mocha and Chai, I am also learning what to look out for. Getting into the mindset of who will try to mess up my code.
